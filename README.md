# sparkles-bot

Just a small bot for my first discord bot using discord.py that repeats all messages with a little flavour of ✨


## Usage
Invite it to your server at https://brandonly.me/sparkle-bot

You can toggle it on or off per channel using `sparkle on` and `sparkle off` respectively 

## To-Do

### Features
- [x] Per Channel On/Off
- [ ] Image manipulation to repeat images with a bit of ✨

### Fixes

- [ ] Rewrite with commands extension
- [x] Rewrite channel array to account for different servers
    (If a server has the same channel name e.g. #general, it'll toggle it for both servers)
